#Instructions:
# 1. Change the TOP setting in the [General] section to where you want all
#    the Buddy managed files to be stored. This is where the clean checkouts,
#    dirty fixups, tarballs and other Buddy files will be stored.
#    So make sure you have a lot of diskspace available for TOP.
#
# 2. Set a Project name in the [General] section.
#
# 3. Set the Major, Minor, Patch, etc settings in the [Release] section
#    according to the release you want to make.
#
# 4. You can adjust the Git or SVN settings in the [DEFAULT] section if desired
#
# NOTE: this configuration file should be re-used for all releases in the
#       lifespan of the major release. i.e. you should re-use this for
#       KDE 4.8.80 all the way through to KDE 4.9.4. Only the settings in
#       the [Release] section should need to be modified.
