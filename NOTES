# Check Bugzilla for showstopper bugs
# Don't push tags until after tarballs are accepted (do we need to wait even longer?)
# Somehow "pre-tag" and tar at the same time
# Could it use zip instead of tar (especially for Windows?) [CPack]
# CRLFs instead of newlines would be needed on Windows [can CPack do this?]

#TODO: give bcooksley and PoVAddict a python program that branches
#      each project and optionally pushes that new branch
#      (options: --create-only, --dry-run)

# We need to tar from a tag.  So we need a tagging program
# Then we need an option to the tagging program that actually pushes

#
# When moving to new minor versions (i.e. 4.8 to 4.9), we are permitted
# to branch kdelibs for versioning purposes.  As dfaure says, "I'm opposed
# to new branches to maintain. Switching to "bugfixes in 4.8" to "bugfixes
# in 4.9, 4.8 is dead" doesn't increase the number of branches to maintain,
# so that's fine.

# kde-base-artwork is still in SVN (because of the fear of putting binary
# files into a Git repo).  But it really belongs in kde-workspace.  So we
# should package as part of the kde-workspace

# run sha256sum *.xz and put that info in the sysadmin bug report when
# the request to move them from incoming to the final place is made.

# note: the sysadmins run sha256sum -c to validate the .xz files
# before moving them from /incoming to the final place

Update kdepackages in kdelibs/kdeui
In the stable branch, remove the MALLOC_CHECK_ block from kdebase/workspace/startkde.cmake
Run "fixuifiles"
Make sure the meinproc in path is a version of the correct branch
Use tag_all to get clean sources into "clean" directory (e.g. <releasedir>/clean/koffice)
Make tarballs using "pack <module>". Start with kde-i18n. Do kdelibs/kdebase last
